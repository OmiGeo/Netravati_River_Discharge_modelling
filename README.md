# Netravati_River_Discharge_modelling
In this project a regression based model created for discharge prediction of Netravati river basin. 
Total 22 years of data collected, data for rianfall, evapotranspiration, soilmoisture, riverdischare, relative humidity is collected from different sources. 
First the preprocessing applied on data and all null values are removed and exploratoray analysis done to understand the rainfall and discharge trends. 
The model for Random forest, Gradient Boost, XGBOOST, and SVM developed 
Finally the model evaluated using R2, RMSE, MAE, PBias, NSE. 
The plot for observed vs predicted plotted.
